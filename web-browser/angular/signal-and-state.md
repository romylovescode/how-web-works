Angular Signals represent a fundamental shift in how we handle 
reactive
 
state management
 within Angular applications. A 
Signal
 is essentially a 
wrapper
 around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. This wrapper provides a consistent and efficient way to 
track
 changes and 
update
 the 
application
 accordingly.

Signal's Primary Characteristics
Signals in Angular are defined by three core characteristics that make them powerful tools for state management. First, they are readable values that can be accessed synchronously. Second, they maintain a 
dependency
 tracking system that automatically updates dependent computations. Third, they provide built-in 
change detection
 
optimization
.
